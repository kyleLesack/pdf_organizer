ebook_renamer:
	Well documented
	Looks very robust, but requires calibre, which I had some trouble installing
paper-renamer
pdf2ic
pdfquery
pdf-rename:	
	Poorly documented
	Looks it renames pdf files and changes metadata based on user input, rather than automatically parsing files
pdf-title-rename:
	Looks like it goes off of the file metadata; I couldn't get the dependencies to install
